# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Editor Package
This repository showcases a re-usable tree component that renders a tree-master-detail JSON editor.

The repository contains an IDE webcomponent that additionally configures 3 buttons to access the data shown in the tree:
- A download button
- An export button that shows the data in a dialog
- A load button that opens a native file selection dialog to load a file from the user's harddrive

Additionally, the package contains a small runtime demo showing an editor for users and tasks.

The Editor Package was actively maintained with JSON Forms up until [version `2.3.2`](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/0cf18d3df877c5240188b0ae4e0d18e3638fc026).

## Professional support
